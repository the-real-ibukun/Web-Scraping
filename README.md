# Web Scraping

To put in a nutshell, web scraping is a process of data extraction from websites. All the job is carried out by a piece of code which is called a “scraper”. First, it sends a “GET” query to a specific website. Then, it parses an HTML document based on the received result. After it’s done, the scraper searches for the data you need within the document, and, finally, converts it into whatever specified format. - culled from Upwork
